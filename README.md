# fractal-rs

# ⚠️WIP⚠️

## For use in Linux only!

The code compiles into an executable that renders various kinds of fractals (`mandelbrot` or `burningship`) directly into the framebuffer. 

This even without the X11 server.

## How to use?

- Compile with cargo `build --release`

- Switch to a tty with `ctrl + alt + f2` 

- Clear the console with `clear`

- Execute the binary with `./fractal`
